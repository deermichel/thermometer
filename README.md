# thermometer
Welcome to my Raspberry Pico hello world project, a breadboard thermometer featuring a [DHT22 sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/385) and a [16x2 LCD](https://www.adafruit.com/product/181).
I challenged myself to write the drivers from scratch based on some crappy chinasheets - so handle with care ;).

## Features
- Display current temperature and humidity (updates every 30s)
- Minimum and maximum values, press switch to toggle screen, hold switch to reset values
- Maybe some bugs because embedded is *fun*

## Build Instructions
0. Prerequisites
    - Setup a Raspberry Pico dev environment: [Getting started guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf). Make sure the SDK example projects compile.
    - Arrange the hardware components on a breadboard: You'll need a Raspberry Pico, a DHT22 sensor, a LCD1602-type display with parallel data lines (my app uses the 4-bit interface), a switch (optional, for min-max values), some resistors to adjust the LCD contrast at V0 and a bunch of wires.
    - I used the following [pinout](https://pico.pinout.xyz/), but feel free to adjust the pins in [main.c](src/main.c):
        | Physical | GPIO | Connected to |
        | -------- | ---- | ------------ |
        | 12       | GP9  | DHT Data     |
        | 19       | GP14 | Switch (to GND) |
        | 21       | GP16 | LCD RS       |
        | 22       | GP17 | LCD D7       |
        | 24       | GP18 | LCD D6       |
        | 25       | GP19 | LCD D5       |
        | 26       | GP20 | LCD D4       |
        | 27       | GP21 | LCD EN       |

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    # clone via ssh
    git clone git@github.com:deermichel/thermometer.git

    # or via https
    git clone https://github.com/deermichel/thermometer.git
    ```

2. Build the app
    ```sh
    # ensure PICO_SDK_PATH points to the SDK path
    echo $PICO_SDK_PATH

    # configure
    cd thermometer
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..

    # build
    make -j
    ```

3. Flash, run, pray
    - Use the `thermometer.uf2` or `thermometer.elf` output file for flashing. Refer to the "Getting started" guide if you need help with this step.
    - If you wired everything correctly, you got yourself another thermometer - congrats! Now go ahead and change your LinkedIn bio to Embedded Software Engineer :)
